### Messaging System Overview

The messaging system in the `gAgents` framework enables communication between agents. It allows agents to send and receive messages over gRPC, a high-performance, language-agnostic remote procedure call (RPC) framework.

Here's how it works:

1. **Message Struct and Envelope**: In the framework, we define a `Message` struct which serves as the core structure for communication. This struct contains essential fields like `Receiver`, `Sender`, `Protocol`, and `Content` which allow agents to specify the sender, receiver, message type, and content.

2. **Message Serialization**: To send messages over gRPC, we need to serialize them into a format that can be transmitted over the network. We use JSON serialization to convert the `Message` struct into a byte array.

3. **gRPC Communication**: Agents use gRPC to send and receive messages. When an agent wants to send a message, it establishes a connection to the receiver's address and transmits the serialized message.

4. **Envelope**: To simplify message handling, we introduced the concept of an `Envelope`. An `Envelope` encapsulates a `Message` along with sender, receiver, and type information. It provides convenience methods to serialize and deserialize messages.

5. **Handling Received Messages**: When an agent receives a message, it processes the incoming message by deserializing the content and handling it based on the message type. This is where developers can define custom logic to respond to different types of messages.

6. **Handler Registration**: Agents have the ability to register message handlers. Handlers are responsible for processing messages of a specific type. For example, a "greeting" handler might handle messages of type "greet".

7. **Sending and Receiving Messages**: Agents have channels (`InMessageQueue` and `OutMessageQueue`) for receiving and sending messages, respectively. Messages are passed between agents through these channels.

### Use Case Example

For instance, consider a scenario where we have two agents, "Agent1" and "Agent2". Agent1 wants to send a greeting message to Agent2.

1. Agent1 creates a `TestMessage` struct with the appropriate receiver, sender, type, and content.

2. Agent1 then creates an `Envelope` using the `NewEnvelope` function, which serializes the message and bundles it with sender, receiver, and type information.

3. The `Envelope` is placed in Agent1's `OutMessageQueue` for sending.

4. Agent1's goroutine for consuming outbound messages sends the `Envelope` over gRPC to Agent2.

5. Agent2 receives the gRPC message and extracts the `Envelope`.

6. Agent2 uses the `ToMessage` method to deserialize the message content into a `TestMessage` struct.

7. Agent2 then looks up the appropriate handler (in this case, the "greet" handler) and calls its `HandleMessage` method.

8. The "greet" handler processes the greeting message and performs any necessary actions.

This messaging system facilitates communication between agents, allowing for the exchange of information and coordination of tasks.
